//! The vault's link graph, and where to draw it.
//!
//! Layout lives here rather than in Swift for the reason the rest of the core
//! does: a force-directed layout is an inner loop over every pair of nodes,
//! run to convergence, and it has nothing to do with AppKit. Swift receives
//! finished coordinates and draws them.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Nodes start on a golden-angle spiral, not at random positions, and the
//! iteration count is fixed. The same vault therefore always lays out the
//! same way — the graph does not rearrange itself every time the panel is
//! opened, and the layout can be asserted in a test rather than eyeballed.
