//! Incremental reparsing.
//!
//! # What was tried first, and why it is not here
//!
//! The obvious design is to cut the document at block boundaries, reparse the
//! slice, and splice the result back. It was built, and the property test in
//! `tests/incremental.rs` took it apart in four stages:
//!
//! 1. An edit that opens a code fence swallows the rest of the file.
//! 2. ```` ```# Heading ```` is an *opening* fence with an info string, not a
//!    closing one, so naive fence counting called an unbalanced slice
//!    balanced.
//! 3. A list continues lazily into the paragraph below it, growing past the
//!    boundary the slice was cut on.
//! 4. Even a *correctly bounded* top-level slice reparses its **nested**
//!    blocks differently in isolation — a list item's extent depends on what
//!    follows the list.
//!
//! Each fix revealed the next. The lesson is that a Markdown block's meaning
//! is not determined by its own text, so "reparse this block" has no
//! well-defined answer.
//!
//! # What is here instead
//!
//! A fast path that changes no structure at all, and therefore needs no
//! reparse — only arithmetic. It applies when the edit provably cannot alter
//! anything except offsets:
//!
//! - the inserted and removed text are **inert** (see [`is_inert`]): plain
//!   words, no newlines, nothing that opens a block or an inline construct;
//! - the edit lands inside a **plain-prose** top-level block — one with no
//!   inline-significant characters anywhere in it, so no emphasis, link, or
//!   code span can be created or destroyed by moving text around;
//! - the edit is clear of the line's first four columns, where block markers
//!   live.
//!
//! Under those conditions the correct new parse *is* the old parse with
//! offsets shifted, which is why this path can be trusted. Everything else
//! takes a full reparse — 2.55ms for 10,000 lines in release, which is
//! already inside a 60fps frame.
